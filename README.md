**For our api, we used Adonis Js 5**

Adonis JS 5 offers a user-friendly experience akin to Laravel, making web development accessible. While it may have a slightly older feel, it remains a reliable and usable framework. However, it's essential to note that Adonis JS 5 lacks support for the .edge file extension, which may impact certain aspects of your project. Consider this factor when evaluating its suitability for your development needs.

**For our backend and frontend, we used NextJs**

Next.js, a powerful React framework, stands out as a reliable and user-friendly tool for web development. Its seamless integration with React makes it an ideal choice for building robust applications. While the performance is commendable, the comparison with React itself might be subjective, as it depends on specific use cases and project requirements.

Notably, Next.js boasts a thriving community, providing an abundance of resources to support your coding journey. Whether you're a beginner seeking tutorials or an experienced developer looking for advanced techniques, the wealth of community-driven content ensures you have the guidance you need.

The framework's versatility shines in its support for server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering. This flexibility empowers developers to choose the approach that best suits their project goals.

Additionally, Next.js excels in optimizing for search engine performance, ensuring that your applications are not only functional but also discoverable. The built-in support for TypeScript adds another layer of convenience for developers aiming for robust and statically-typed code.

Considering its rich feature set, developer-friendly environment, and a supportive community, Next.js emerges as a go-to solution for those looking to harness the full potential of React in their web development endeavors.
